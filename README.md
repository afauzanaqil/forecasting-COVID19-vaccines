Forecasting COVID-19 Vaccines Trend with Deep Learning Technique 

# How to Usage
Please, connect with Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook with provided Dataset 

## 1. Forecast_COVID-19_Vaccines_ARIMA
### Dataset: Country Vaccinations
List of Code:
  1) Exploration Data Analysis including Vaccination Count, Total Vaccination, etc
  2) Forecasting Depend on Highest Vaccine Used
  3) Future Prediction and Comparison
  4) Evaluation Metrics

## 2. Forecast_COVID-19_Vaccines_LSTM
### Dataset: Country Vaccination, Countries Aggregated
List of Code:
  1) Exploration on Each Country
  2) Forecasting Depend on Specific Country (e.g. in this experiment take Indonesia)
  3) Future Prediction and Comparison
  4) Evaluation Metrics

## 3. Forecast_COVID-19_Vaccines_LR
### Dataset: Country Vaccination, Countries Aggregated
List of Code:
  1) Exploration Data on Total Vaccination Depend on Country, Corelation Heatmap, etc
  2) Prediction Section Depend on Highest Vaccine Used
  3) Prediction over next 30, 60, 90 days
  4) Evaluation Metrics

## 4. Forecast_COVID-19_Vaccines_Prophet
### Dataset: Country Vaccination, Gapminder Tidy
List of Code:
  1) Exploration Data on Classification of Region Vaccine
  2) Forecasting Prediction Depend on People Fully Vaccinated per Hundred
  3) Evaluation Metrics
  4) Fix for Forecasting in Prophet Depend on Daily Vaccination
  5) Trend and Weekly Data
